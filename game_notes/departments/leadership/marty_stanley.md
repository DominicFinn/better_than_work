Good old friendly Marty, he's been around the block. Having been a serial middle manager at some of the countries largest supermarkets until he accidentally found himself an executive, he's got a lot of insight on anything you might be trying to do. In fact, he's sure you aren't doing it right. Don't worry he won't tell you though, he'll save that for behind your back.
