It's budget time. We are going to need to see a massive uplift in revenue, an exponential increase in margin but there's going to be no extra money, not yet. 

Not that money is needed. What's needed is a positive mental attitude, some strong leadership and some serious number massaging. 

Keep submitting the budget to us whilst the board provide feedback.
