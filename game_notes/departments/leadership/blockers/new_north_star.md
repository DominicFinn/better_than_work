Are we being ambitous enough? If we want Flourish we need to be the next Unicorn, we need to be focused on a single metric. 

It doesn't matter how we get there. Some fires will have to burn. We've found our new North Star. Onwards and upwards! 

First things first, let's create a new report suite and training to help our team understand how important our new North Star is. GO TEAM!
