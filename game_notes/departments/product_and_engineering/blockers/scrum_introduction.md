What do you do when no-one can be arsed to write a spec or think about work? 

That's right! Scrum. Now you can get even less done with more people! All your work is now broken down into meaningless tickets that would get refined if they could ever make thier way up the backlog. 

You know the answer, the refinement meetings aren't long enough. We can sort out the details in the next sprint.
