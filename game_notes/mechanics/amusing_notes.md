# Intro

You work for *Flourish*. 

Be Bold, Be Brave, Flourish. It's not entirely clear what the Flourish do but most employees suggest the company will IPO within a 3 year plan. During your onboarding, you are all excited to be joining such a fast paced young company. Your HR representative has an air of superiority which leaves you excited "this must be an amazing company". You are rearing to go once, there's just that paperwork to complete and the mandatory HR training sessions and then you can really begin to make the real change you've always wanted to.  

You need to earn the maximum cash doing the minimum work. How do you get recognised with a bonus whilst at the same time, avoid being in meetings all day listening to wankers. 

If you end up in meetings all day how should this effect your percieved productivity? 

We need lots of diferent types of events that will eventually fill your diary up like tetris. If you don't deal with it. 

If you don't attend the events you lose some sort of statistic. Like relationship points with the individual. 



## Statistics

- Perception
- Warnings
- Relationship points
- Bonus
- Rating

Measurement events: 
 
- Weekly one to one
- Quarterly review
- Annual review

How do you actually move along in the game? Should it be like a corporate ladder? 

Do you just roll dice and you move along? 

How do I fit in the calendar idea with the board game? 

Maybe it's a card building game? 

### Dice based game
Like a traditional board game? Like a corporate ladder? 

I need to make a prototype of the game. 

### Card based game
What do you do in a card based game. If I was to copy dominion say....

You get a certain amount of bronze, silver and gold and then you "buy" things for your dominion and ultimately you get buy provinces.... Maybe instead of provinces, you 

### Hybrid
So you do need to move along the board you collect cards along the way...

The winner is the one who climbs to the top of the corporate ladder I guess then. Maybe the board is literally a ladder and then then you pick events and people along the way. 

The cards represent both meetings and people. 

OK so the idea is that you should probably collect as few cards as possible because the unspoken rule is that you should just "do it yourself". 

You are going to need some sort of morale cards, some sort of productivity cards.  



Expansion Packs: 

- The takeover
- Alien invasion

# Deck building dynamics

The beauty of this you would be able to burn cards, you could use 


Dynamics 
- Presentation 
- Contracts
- Layoffs
- Restructure
- Cocktail party / Work event
    - where you've cocked up, said something strange
- Equality and diversity
- Training stuff


Offloading people onto other players, how do you do a restructure into the game. 

*OK so we are definitely making a deck buiding game. That's definitely going to be the most fun.*
