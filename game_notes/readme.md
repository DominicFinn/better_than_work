# Flourish

Flourish has the best team in the world. They've grown quickly from a startup last week to a team of hundreds. 

It's not been easy and tensions are high. The team work so seamlessly, they've joined together into one giant squad. Be careful though, among the progress, a couple of bad apples exist. These lone wolfs try to get the work done for the rest of the business. Luckily, the team have a host of amazing policies, investigations and procedures to keep Flourish on track. 

Be bold, be brave, jump into your first all hands feet first!
